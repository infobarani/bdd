Feature: Timing Accuracy

  As a developer, I want to ensure the system maintains timing accuracy.

  Scenario: TC-6.1: Long-Term Timing Drift
    # This is not practical to test in a BDD scenario.
    # It would require running the simulation for an hour.
    Given the traffic controller is initialized
