Feature: Normal Traffic Flow Cycle

  As a driver, I expect the traffic light system to cycle through its states correctly and predictably.

  Scenario: TC-1.1: Complete Normal Cycle Without Pedestrian Request
    Given the traffic controller is initialized
    Then the main light should be Green
    And the side light should be Red
    And the pedestrian signal should be Don't Walk

    When {MAIN_GREEN_DURATION_SECONDS} seconds pass
    Then the main light should be Yellow
    And the side light should be Red
    And the pedestrian signal should be Don't Walk

    When {MAIN_YELLOW_DURATION_SECONDS} seconds pass
    Then the main light should be Red
    And the side light should be Red
    And the pedestrian signal should be Don't Walk

    When {ALL_RED_DURATION_SECONDS} seconds pass
    Then the main light should be Red
    And the side light should be Green
    And the pedestrian signal should be Don't Walk

    When {SIDE_GREEN_DURATION_SECONDS} seconds pass
    Then the main light should be Red
    And the side light should be Yellow
    And the pedestrian signal should be Don't Walk

    When {SIDE_YELLOW_DURATION_SECONDS} seconds pass
    Then the main light should be Red
    And the side light should be Red
    And the pedestrian signal should be Don't Walk

    When {ALL_RED_DURATION_SECONDS} seconds pass
    Then the main light should be Green
    And the side light should be Red
    And the pedestrian signal should be Don't Walk

  Scenario: TC-1.2: Default State Verification
    Given the traffic controller is initialized
    Then the main light should be Green
    And the side light should be Red
    And the pedestrian signal should be Don't Walk
